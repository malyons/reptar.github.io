title: Configuration
---

Most of Reptar's flexibility comes from its ability to be configured and changed to meet your needs.

All of the configuration for your Reptar site resides in your `reptar.config.js` file. This file is what Reptar uses when building your site. The more you understand this file the more power you have to make Reptar build the site you want.

#### [Read all default settings and what they control from the default settings file.](https://github.com/reptar/reptar/blob/master/lib/config/config-example.js)

**Note**: Reptar provides sensible default values for your `reptar.config.js` by taking the above default settings as the base settings onto which your local `reptar.config.js` file overwrites.
