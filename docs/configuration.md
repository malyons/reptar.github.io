title: Configuration

Most of Reptar's flexibility comes from its ability to be configured and changed to meet your needs.

All of the configuration for your Reptar site resides in your `_config.yml` file. This file is what Reptar uses to decide how to build your site.

Understanding the `_config.yml` file, and how to update it, is how you will make Reptar work best for you.

**Note**: Reptar provides sensible default values for your `_config.yml` by taking the above default settings as the base settings onto which your local `_config.yml` file overwrites.
